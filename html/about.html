          Susanto Liman, founder and CEO of MR.COFFEE, began with a simple belief: coffee is more than a drink—it’s a bridge between people. Nestled in a bustling city, his cozy shop became a sanctuary of mismatched chairs, doodle-covered walls, and beans sourced from remote mountaintops. For Susanto, every cup carried a story, brewed by baristas who treated espresso as art and customers as family.

            At MR.COFFEE, we envision a world where every sip transcends borders—a digital frontier where coffee lovers, dreamers, and creators unite, unbound by geography. We see a future where our mismatched chairs multiply into virtual tables, where doodles become pixels, and where the warmth of our shop stretches across screens, inviting the globe to gather. By blending the aroma of handpicked beans with the pulse of technology, we aim to redefine connection, proving that even in a fast-paced world, the magic of shared stories, laughter, and bold ideas can thrive—one brew, one click, and one heart at a time.

          <p>
            It began with a handwritten sign in a dusty city corner—“MR.COFFEE: Brews & Daydreams Welcome.” What started as a tiny shop with creaky floors and a secondhand espresso machine soon became a sanctuary. Susanto Liman, a former traveler with a knack for spotting magic in the mundane, filled MR.COFFEE with beans from misty Ethiopian highlands, Colombian cloud forests, and Sumatra’s volcanic slopes. But the real secret? The baristas—poets in aprons—who turned lattes into canvases and customers into collaborators. Regulars left doodles on napkins, scribbled quotes on walls, and lingered over cups as sunlight filtered through steam. Now, as the world grows faster, MR.COFFEE’s story continues—not just in the clatter of porcelain, but in pixels and code. We’re rewriting what it means to gather, blending the earthy grit of coffee cherries with the glow of screens, because every era deserves a place where wonder is brewed, and strangers feel like home.
